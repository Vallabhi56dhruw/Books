    <p>Nirmala is the story of a young girl who is married to an elderly man due to
	the lack of dowry after her father's death. It describes the misfortune and suspicions that
	she has to face and her downfall after the continuous stress and mental trauma that she has to 
	go through. The story very well depicts the pathetic social condition of women during that era.</p>

	 <p>A classic coming-of-age story which has held generations of readers spellbound!
	 Rusty, a sixteen-year-old Anglo-Indian boy, is orphaned and has to live with his English guardian in the
	 claustrophobic European part in Dehra Dun. Unhappy with the strict ways of his guardian, Rusty runs away from
	 home to live with his Indian friends. Plunging for the first time into the dream-bright world of the bazaar,
	 Hindu festivals and other aspects of Indian life, Rusty is enchanted … and is lost forever to the prim proprieties
	 of the European community. Written when the author was himself seventeen, this moving story of love and friendship, 
	 with a new introduction and illustrations will be enjoyed by a whole new generation of readers.</p>
